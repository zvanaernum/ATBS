If you want your programs to read or write to PDFs or Word documents, you’ll need to do more than simply pass their filenames to open().\n",

To install it, run pip install --user PyPDF2==1.26.0 from the command line. This module name is case sensitive, so make sure the y is lowercase and everything else is uppercase. (Check out Appendix A for full details about installing third-party modules.) If the module was installed correctly, running import PyPDF2 in the interactive shell shouldn’t display any errors."

    "### Extracting Text from PDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPDF2 does not have a way to extract images, charts, or other media from PDF documents, but it can extract text and return it as a Python string. To start learning how PyPDF2 works, we’ll use it on the example PDF shown in Figure 15-1. Download this PDF from https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2/ and enter the following into the interactive shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, import the PyPDF2 module. Then open meetingminutes.pdf in read binary mode and store it in pdfFileObj. To get a PdfFileReader object that represents this PDF, call PyPDF2.PdfFileReader() and pass it pdfFileObj. Store this PdfFileReader object in pdfReader.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of pages in the document is stored in the numPages attribute of a PdfFileReader object ➊. The example PDF has 19 pages, but let’s extract text from only the first page.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract text from a page, you need to get a Page object, which represents a single page of a PDF, from a PdfFileReader object. You can get a Page object by calling the getPage() method ➋ on a PdfFileReader object and passing it the page number of the page you’re interested in—in our case, 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPDF2 uses a zero-based index for getting pages: The first page is page 0, the second is page 1, and so on. This is always the case, even if pages are numbered differently within the document. For example, say your PDF is a three-page excerpt from a longer report, and its pages are numbered 42, 43, and 44. To get the first page of this document, you would want to call pdfReader.getPage(0), not getPage(42) or getPage(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your Page object, call its extractText() method to return a string of the page’s text ➌. The text extraction isn’t perfect: The text Charles E. “Chas” Roemer, President from the PDF is absent from the string returned by extractText(), and the spacing is sometimes off. Still, this approximation of the PDF text content may be good enough for your program"

If decrypt() returns 1, then your program should break out of the loop and print the hacked password. You should try both the uppercase and lowercase form of each word.
