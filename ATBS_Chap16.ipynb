    "# Chapter 16: Working with CSV files and JSON data\n",
    "In Chapter 15, you learned how to extract text from PDF and Word documents. These files were in a binary format, which required special Python modules to access their data. CSV and JSON files, on the other hand, are just plaintext files. You can view them in a text editor, such as Mu. But Python also comes with the special csv and json modules, each providing functions to help you work with these file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV stands for “comma-separated values,” and CSV files are simplified spreadsheets stored as plaintext files. Python’s csv module makes it easy to parse CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (pronounced “JAY-sawn” or “Jason”—it doesn’t matter how because either way people will say you’re pronouncing it wrong) is a format that stores information as JavaScript source code in plaintext files. (JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation.) You don’t need to know the JavaScript programming language to use JSON files, but the JSON format is useful to know because it’s used in many web applications."

    "## The csv Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in a CSV file represents a row in the spreadsheet, and commas separate the cells in the row. For example, the spreadsheet example.xlsx from https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2/ would look like this in a CSV file:\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use this file for this chapter’s interactive shell examples. You can download example.csv from https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2/ or enter the text into a text editor and save it as example.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV files are simple, lacking many of the features of an Excel spreadsheet. For example, CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Don’t have types for their values—everything is a string\n",
    "    Don’t have settings for font size or color\n",
    "    Don’t have multiple worksheets\n",
    "    Can’t specify cell widths and heights\n",
    "    Can’t have merged cells\n",
    "    Can’t have images or charts embedded in them\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of CSV files is simplicity. CSV files are widely supported by many types of programs, can be viewed in text editors (including Mu), and are a straightforward way to represent spreadsheet data. The CSV format is exactly as advertised: it’s just a text file of comma-separated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since CSV files are just text files, you might be tempted to read them in as a string and then process that string using the techniques you learned in Chapter 9. For example, since each cell in a CSV file is separated by a comma, maybe you could just call split(',') on each line of text to get the comma-separated values as a list of strings. But not every comma in a CSV file represents the boundary between two cells. CSV files also have their own set of escape characters to allow commas and other characters to be included as part of the values. The split() method doesn’t handle these escape characters. Because of these potential pitfalls, you should always use the csv module for reading and writing CSV files."
