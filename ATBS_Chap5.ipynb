    "### Nested Dictionaries and Lists\n",
    "Modeling a tic-tac-toe board was fairly simple: the board needed only a single dictionary value with nine key-value pairs. As you model more complicated things, you may find you need dictionaries and lists that contain other dictionaries and lists. Lists are useful to contain an ordered series of values, and dictionaries are useful for associating keys with values. For example, here’s a program that uses a dictionary that contains other dictionaries of what items guests are bringing to a picnic. The totalBrought() function can read this data structure and calculate the total number of an item being brought by all the guests."
