    "# Chapter 13: Working with Excel Spreadsheets\n",
    "Although we don’t often think of spreadsheets as programming tools, almost everyone uses them to organize information into two-dimensional data structures, perform calculations with formulas, and produce output as charts. In the next two chapters, we’ll integrate Python into two popular spreadsheet applications: Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel is a popular and powerful spreadsheet application for Windows. The openpyxl module allows your Python programs to read and modify Excel spreadsheet files. For example, you might have the boring task of copying certain data from one spreadsheet and pasting it into another one. Or you might have to go through thousands of rows and pick out just a handful of them to make small edits based on some criteria. Or you might have to look through hundreds of spreadsheets of department budgets, searching for any that are in the red. These are exactly the sort of boring, mindless spreadsheet tasks that Python can do for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Excel is proprietary software from Microsoft, there are free alternatives that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Both LibreOffice Calc and OpenOffice Calc work with Excel’s .xlsx file format for spreadsheets, which means the openpyxl module can work on spreadsheets from these applications as well. You can download the software from https://www.libreoffice.org/ and https://www.openoffice.org/, respectively. Even if you already have Excel installed on your computer, you may find these programs easier to use. The screenshots in this chapter, however, are all from Excel 2010 on Windows 10."

    "First, let’s go over some basic definitions: an Excel spreadsheet document is called a workbook. A single workbook is saved in a file with the .xlsx extension. Each workbook can contain multiple sheets (also called worksheets). The sheet the user is currently viewing (or last viewed before closing Excel) is called the active sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sheet has columns (addressed by letters starting at A) and rows (addressed by numbers starting at 1). A box at a particular column and row is called a cell. Each cell can contain a number or text value. The grid of cells with data makes up a sheet."

It’s important that you install this version by running pip install --user -U openpyxl==2.6.2 because newer versions of OpenPyXL are incompatible with the information in this book. To test whether it is installed correctly, enter the following into the interactive shell:"
