    "# Chapter 9: Reading and Writing Files\n",
    "Variables are a fine way to store data while your program is running, but if you want your data to persist even after your program has finished, you need to save it to a file. You can think of a file’s contents as a single string value, potentially gigabytes in size. In this chapter, you will learn how to use Python to create, read, and save files on the hard drive."

    "## Files and File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "A file has two key properties: a filename (usually written as one word) and a path. The path specifies the location of a file on the computer. For example, there is a file on my Windows laptop with the filename project.docx in the path C:\\Users\\Al\\Documents. The part of the filename after the last period is called the file’s extension and tells you a file’s type. The filename project.docx is a Word document, and Users, Al, and Documents all refer to folders (also called directories). Folders can contain files and other folders. For example, project.docx is in the Documents folder, which is inside the Al folder, which is inside the Users folder. Figure 9-1 shows this folder organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C:\\ part of the path is the root folder, which contains all other folders. On Windows, the root folder is named C:\\ and is also called the C: drive. On macOS and Linux, the root folder is /. In this book, I’ll use the Windows-style root folder, C:\\. If you are entering the interactive shell examples on macOS or Linux, enter / instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional volumes, such as a DVD drive or USB flash drive, will appear differently on different operating systems. On Windows, they appear as new, lettered root drives, such as D:\\ or E:\\. On macOS, they appear as new folders under the /Volumes folder. On Linux, they appear as new folders under the /mnt (“mount”) folder. Also note that while folder names and filenames are not case-sensitive on Windows and macOS, they are case-sensitive on Linux."

If I had called this function on, say, Linux, Path() would have returned a PosixPath object that, when passed to str(), would have returned 'spam/bacon/eggs'.

    "On Windows, the backslash separates directories, so you can’t use it in filenames. However, you can use backslashes in filenames on macOS and Linux. So while Path(r'spam\\eggs') refers to two separate folders (or a file eggs in a folder spam) on Windows, the same command would refer to a single folder (or file) named spam\\eggs on macOS and Linux. For this reason, it’s usually a good idea to always use forward slashes in your Python code (and I’ll be doing so for the rest of this chapter). The pathlib module will ensure that it always works on all operating systems.\n",

The Python Standard Library modules support it as of Python 3.6, but if you are working with legacy Python 2 versions, I recommend using pathlib2, which gives you pathlib’s features on Python 2.7. Appendix A has instructions for installing pathlib2 using pip. Whenever I’ve replaced an older os.path function with pathlib, I’ve made a short note. You can look up the older functions at https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html."

    "We normally use the + operator to add two integer or floating-point numbers, such as in the expression 2 + 2, which evaluates to the integer value 4. But we can also use the + operator to concatenate two string values, like the expression 'Hello' + 'World', which evaluates to the string value 'HelloWorld'. Similarly, the / operator that we normally use for division can also combine Path objects and strings. This is helpful for modifying a Path object after you’ve already created it with the Path() function."
