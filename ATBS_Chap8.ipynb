    "# Chapter 8: Input Validation\n",
    "Input validation code checks that values entered by the user, such as text from the input() function, are formatted correctly. For example, if you want users to enter their ages, your code shouldn’t accept nonsensical answers such as negative numbers (which are outside the range of acceptable integers) or words (which are the wrong data type). Input validation can also prevent bugs or security vulnerabilities. If you implement a withdrawFromAccount() function that takes an argument for the amount to subtract from an account, you need to ensure the amount is a positive number. If the withdrawFromAccount() function subtracts a negative number from the account, the “withdrawal” will end up adding money!"

Let’s create a program that poses 10 multiplication problems to the user, where the valid input is the problem’s correct answer. Open a new file editor tab and save the file as multiplicationQuiz.py.\n",

The argument we pass for allowRegexes is a list with the regex string '^%s$', where %s is replaced with the correct answer. The ^ and % characters ensure that the answer begins and ends with the correct number, though PyInputPlus trims any whitespace from the start and end of the user’s response first just in case they inadvertently pressed the spacebar before or after their answer. The argument we pass for blocklistRegexes is a list with ('.*', 'Incorrect!'). The first string in the tuple is a regex that matches every possible string. Therefore, if the user response doesn’t match the correct answer, the program will reject any other answer they provide. In that case, the 'Incorrect!' string is displayed and the user is prompted to answer again. Additionally, passing 8 for timeout and 3 for limit will ensure that the user only has 8 seconds and 3 tries to provide a correct answer:\n",

    "If the user answers after the 8-second timeout has expired, even if they answer correctly, pyip.inputStr() raises a TimeoutException exception. If the user answers incorrectly more than 3 times, it raises a RetryLimitException exception. Both of these exception types are in the PyInputPlus module, so pyip. needs to prepend them:\n",

After the program has asked 10 questions and the for loop continues, let’s show the user how many correct answers they made:\n",
