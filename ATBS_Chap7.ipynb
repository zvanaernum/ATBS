    "# Pattern Matching with regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familiar with searching for text by pressing CTRL-F and entering the words you’re looking for. Regular expressions go one step further: they allow you to specify a pattern of text to search for. You may not know a business’s exact phone number, but if you live in the United States or Canada, you know it will be three digits, followed by a hyphen, and then four more digits (and optionally, a three-digit area code at the start). This is how you, as a human, know a phone number when you see it: 415-555-1234 is a phone number, but 4,155,551,234 is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recognize all sorts of other text patterns every day: email addresses have @ symbols in the middle, US social security numbers have nine digits and two hyphens, website URLs often have periods and forward slashes, news headlines use title case, social media hashtags begin with # and contain no spaces, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are helpful, but few non-programmers know about them even though most modern text editors and word processors, such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, have find and find-and-replace features that can search based on regular expressions. Regular expressions are huge time-savers, not just for software users but also for programmers. In fact, tech writer Cory Doctorow argues that we should be teaching regular expressions even before programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing [regular expressions] can mean the difference between solving a problem in 3 steps and solving it in 3,000 steps. When you’re a nerd, you forget that the problems you solve with a couple keystrokes can take other people days of tedious, error-prone work to slog through.1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you’ll start by writing a program to find text patterns without using regular expressions and then see how to use regular expressions to make the code much less bloated. I’ll show you basic matching with regular expressions and then move on to some more powerful features, such as string substitution and creating your own character classes. Finally, at the end of the chapter, you’ll write a program that can automatically extract phone numbers and email addresses from a block of text."

What about a phone number formatted like 415.555.4242 or (415) 555-4242? What if the phone number had an extension, like 415-555-4242 x99? The isPhoneNumber() function would fail to validate them. You could add yet more code for these additional patterns, but there is an easier way.\n",

The regex \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d is used by Python to match the same text pattern the previous isPhoneNumber() function did: a string of three numbers, a hyphen, three more numbers, another hyphen, and four numbers. Any other string would not match the \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d regex.\n",
