    "# Chapter 10: Organizing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, you learned how to create and write to new files in Python. Your programs can also organize preexisting files on the hard drive. Maybe you’ve had the experience of going through a folder full of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of files and copying, renaming, moving, or compressing them all by hand. Or consider tasks such as these:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Making copies of all PDF files (and only the PDF files) in every subfolder of a folder\n",
    "    Removing the leading zeros in the filenames for every file in a folder of hundreds of files named spam001.txt, spam002.txt, spam003.txt, and so on\n",
    "    Compressing the contents of several folders into one ZIP file (which could be a simple backup system)\n",
    "\n",
    "All this boring stuff is just begging to be automated in Python. By programming your computer to do these tasks, you can transform it into a quick-working file clerk who never makes mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you begin working with files, you may find it helpful to be able to quickly see what the extension (.txt, .pdf, .jpg, and so on) of a file is. With macOS and Linux, your file browser most likely shows extensions automatically. With Windows, file extensions may be hidden by default. To show extensions, go to Start ▸ Control Panel ▸ Appearance and Personalization ▸ Folder Options. On the View tab, under Advanced Settings, uncheck the Hide extensions for known file types checkbox."
