Maybe you’ve had the experience of going through a folder full of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of files and copying, renaming, moving, or compressing them all by hand. Or consider tasks such as these:\n",

    "    Compressing the contents of several folders into one ZIP file (which could be a simple backup system)\n",

With macOS and Linux, your file browser most likely shows extensions automatically. With Windows, file extensions may be hidden by default. To show extensions, go to Start ▸ Control Panel ▸ Appearance and Personalization ▸ Folder Options. On the View tab, under Advanced Settings, uncheck the Hide extensions for known file types checkbox."

The write() method’s first argument is a string of the filename to add. The second argument is the compression type parameter, which tells the computer what algorithm it should use to compress the files; you can always just set this value to zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED. (This specifies the deflate compression algorithm, which works well on all types of data.) Enter the following into the interactive shell:"
